# Dependency Inversion principle

It states that High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend upon details. In other words, A class should depend on abstraction(interfaces and abstract classes) and not on concretion (classes).This principle reduces tight coupling in the system.
